// Why pay a fortune teller when you can just program your fortune yourself?

// Store the following into variables: number of children, partner's name, geographic location, job title.
// Output your fortune to the screen like so: "You will be a X in Y, and married to Z with N kids."

// var numChildren
// var partnerName
// var geoLocation
// var jobTitle

var numChildren = "N"
var partnerName = "Z"
var geoLocation = "Y"
var jobTitle = "X"

console.log("You will be a " + jobTitle + " in " + geoLocation + " and married to " + partnerName + " with " + numChildren + " kids.")


var Q = "You will be a " + jobTitle + " in " + geoLocation + " and married to " + partnerName + " with " + numChildren + " kids."
